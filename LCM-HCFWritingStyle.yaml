# YAML Style Sheet: LCM Writing Style & HCF Editorial Style
# A comprehensive, operational framework for writing and editing
# in the tier of The London Review of Books, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic.
# Version: 1.0 | Type: Meta-Style Guide

meta:
  purpose: "To define a fine-grained, executable framework for creating long-form nonfiction that meets the highest editorial standards of LRB, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic."
  core_concept:
    lcm: "The LOWEST COMMON MULTIPLE. A maximalist, composite writing style that synthesizes the distinct virtues of all three publications into a single, aspirational 'Unicorn Essay' blueprint."
    hcf: "The HIGHEST COMMON FACTOR. The reductive, non-negotiable editorial baseline—the shared DNA that governs selection and quality across all three venues."
  application_paradigm: "LCM is the structural blueprint for drafting. HCF is the quality filter for concept and revision. They are interdependent tools for different phases of work."

# PART 1: THE LCM (LOWEST COMMON MULTIPLE) WRITING STYLE
# The "Unicorn Essay" Blueprint
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LCM_Writing_Style:
  definition: "A 4,000–6,000 word narrative-argumentative hybrid. It uses deep reportage and character work to ground abstract philosophical synthesis, culminating in a clear, normative intervention on a matter of public concern."
  target_output: "The 'Total Essay'—theoretically placable in any of the three venues due to its synthesis of their core stylistic mandates."

  structural_blueprint:
    phase_1_hook:
      name: "The Scene-Setter (The New Yorker Mandate)"
      function: "To establish immediate anecdotal richness, human scale, and narrative momentum. It creates an undeniable 'thereness.'"
      non_negotiable_rules:
        - "MUST open *in media res*. No thesis statements or abstract pronouncements."
        - "MUST center a specific character, a vivid scene, or a concrete anecdote."
        - "The scene selected must be a microcosm capable of bearing the macro-argument to come."
      technique:
        - "Deploy granular, sense-driven detail (sight, sound, texture)."
        - "Introduce a character-in-action or a system-in-operation."
        - "Imply a question or tension; do not state it overtly."
      failure_mode: "A hook that is merely decorative, lacking a necessary, logical connection to the forthcoming pivot."

    phase_2_pivot:
      name: "The Meditative Springboard (LRB Mandate)"
      function: "To reveal the opening scene as a symptom of a larger historical, theoretical, or ideological pattern. It transitions from narrative to synthesis."
      non_negotiable_rules:
        - "MUST use the hook as evidence, not just illustration."
        - "MUST introduce and engage with 2-3 seminal texts, theories, or cultural objects."
        - "The pivot must perform the work of synthesis, not just citation."
      technique:
        - "Employ a 'bridge sentence': 'What I witnessed in X was not an anomaly, but a perfect example of Y's theory of Z...'"
        - "Weave textual analysis into the narrative description. The books explain the scene; the scene interrogates the books."
        - "Assume the reader's familiarity with the canon; engage debates on their own terms."
      failure_mode: "A jarring, non-sequitur shift from scene to theory. The books feel 'tacked on.'"

    phase_3_body:
      name: "The Braided Analysis (The Triple Braid)"
      function: "To maintain simultaneous narrative momentum and intellectual depth by weaving three strands together."
      braid_components:
        strand_a_narrative: "The continuation and development of the initial scene/character. What happens next?"
        strand_b_theoretical: "The expansion of the intellectual framework introduced in the pivot. Historical context, counter-arguments, deeper textual analysis."
        strand_c_argumentative: "The steady, rising thread of the writer's own thesis, gaining clarity and force.
      non_negotiable_rules:
        - "Strands MUST be interwoven on the paragraph, and often sentence, level."
        - "Abstract points MUST be followed or preceded by concrete evidence from the narrative."
        - "The narrative must be 'working' to prove the theory; the theory must be 'explaining' the narrative."
      technique:
        - "Structure paragraphs with a 'concrete -> abstract -> concrete' rhythm."
        - "Use the narrative strand to create cliffhangers that are resolved by theoretical insight."
        - "Let the argumentative strand crystallize at the end of each braided cycle."
      failure_mode: "Block structure (a chunk of narrative, then a chunk of theory). The strands run parallel but never intertwine."

    phase_4_conclusion:
      name: "The Normative Intervention (The Atlantic Mandate)"
      function: "To sharpen the braided analysis into a clear, public-facing argument with stakes and consequences."
      non_negotiable_rules:
        - "MUST answer 'So What?' and 'Why Now?' definitively."
        - "MUST move from diagnosis to prescription, or from analysis to imperative."
        - "MUST be articulated in accessible, non-technical language, regardless of the complexity preceding it."
      technique:
        - "Return to the opening scene/character, now fully re-contextualized by the essay's argument."
        - "State the claim boldly. Use active, imperative phrasing: 'This means we must...', 'The policy of X is therefore a failure...'"
        - "Project the argument's consequences into the immediate future of public debate."
      failure_mode: "An ambiguous, meditative, or merely summative ending. The essay dissolves instead of resolving."

  voice_and_tone_lcm:
    guiding_principle: "The Chameleon Authority: a voice that adapts its color to the phase but never loses its authoritative core."
    by_phase:
      hook: "Vivid, precise, sensory. A confident observer."
      pivot: "Analytical, conversant with academia, yet conversational. A peer to the theorists."
      body: "Braided, rhythmic, masterful. A conductor of ideas and events."
      conclusion: "Direct, urgent, persuasive. A public intellectual."
    forbidden: "Jargon without translation, sentimentalism, cynical detachment, opaque abstraction standing alone."

# PART 2: THE HCF (HIGHEST COMMON FACTOR) EDITORIAL STYLE
# The Universal Baseline & Quality Filter
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HCF_Editorial_Style:
  definition: "The reductive set of first-principles that govern editorial selection and refinement at the tier of LRB, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic. It is the filter through which all ideas and drafts must pass."
  target_output: "A piece that meets the non-negotiable standards of intellectual rigor, structural integrity, and rhetorical force shared by these editors."

  core_principles:
    principle_1:
      name: "Synthesis Over Assessment"
      rule: "The subject (book, event, person) is merely an occasion to reconceptualize a field. Never just review; always reframe."
      editorial_question: "Does this piece change how we think about the category it belongs to?"
      writer_action:
        - "Map the entire existing debate/canon before drafting."
        - "Identify the central, flawed assumption your essay will correct."
        - "Position your chosen subject as the key that unlocks this revision."
      failure_example: "A book review that summarizes and judges the book's quality without placing it in a broader intellectual history."

    principle_2:
      name: "The High-Fidelity Sentence"
      rule: "Every sentence must perform at least two functions (e.g., advance argument + establish tone, convey data + imply judgment). Zero tolerance for fat, filler, or flab."
      editorial_question: "If I remove this sentence, does the piece meaningfully weaken?"
      writer_action:
        - "AUDIT: Read draft aloud, striking any sentence that only performs one task."
        - "COMBINE: Merge simple, sequential sentences into complex, freighted ones."
        - "ACTIVATE: Replace passive voice, weak verbs, and nominalizations with active, vivid constructions."
      failure_example: "Sequential, single-clause sentences that merely list information or observations."

    principle_3:
      name: "The 'So What?' Threshold"
      rule: "The piece must possess urgent, high-stakes relevance. It is an intervention, not a contribution. It must revise history, reveal a hidden narrative, or correct a public misunderstanding."
      editorial_question: "What is the cost of this piece not existing?"
      writer_action:
        - "Articulate the 'Stakes Paragraph' before writing the introduction."
        - "Identify the opponent—a person, a policy, or a widespread belief—that the essay argues against."
        - "Ensure the conclusion mandates a change in thought or action."
      failure_example: "An essay that is 'interesting' or 'informative' but leaves the reader thinking, 'I see, but what am I to do with this?'"

    principle_4:
      name: "Authorial Presence as Expertise"
      rule: "The writer is an expert guide, not a neutral observer. The reader is buying the writer's mind. Voice must project confidence, discernment, and peer-level authority."
      editorial_question: "Do I trust this writer's judgment completely by the end of the first page?"
      writer_action:
        - "Make declarative statements. Hedge only when strategically appropriate."
        - "Position yourself as a peer to your sources ('As Foucault overlooks...')."
        - "Let your unique syntheses and connections be the engine of the argument."
      failure_example: "A piece that reads like a well-written literature review, where the writer's role is merely to summarize others."

  editorial_process_hcf:
    collaborative_stewardship:
      expectation: "The editor is a strategic partner in realizing the piece's maximal potential. The process is intensive, iterative, and can involve significant restructuring."
      writer_mindset: "Editor as essential collaborator, not gatekeeper. The goal is a better piece, not a defended draft."
    revision_filter: "All editorial suggestions should be tested against the HCF Core Principles. A requested change is valid if it enhances Synthesis, Sentence Fidelity, Stakes, or Authorial Presence."

# PART 3: INTEGRATED APPLICATION FRAMEWORK
# How to Use the LCM and HCF in Concert
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated_Application:
  workflow:
    phase_concept:
      primary_tool: "HCF"
      tasks:
        - "Test the idea against HCF Principle 3 (The 'So What?' Threshold). If it passes, proceed."
        - "Draft a 'Stakes Paragraph' defining the intervention."
        - "Decide which publication's 'expression' (LRB/NYer/Atlantic) the concept naturally leans toward for pitching."
      deliverable: "A validated core idea with a defined intervention."

    phase_blueprinting:
      primary_tool: "LCM"
      tasks:
        - "Sketch the LCM Structural Blueprint: Hook, Pivot, Braided Body, Normative Intervention."
        - "Identify the specific Scene (Hook) and the 2-3 key texts (Pivot)."
        - "Outline the braid for the Body, ensuring narrative and theory are paired."
      deliverable: "A detailed structural outline following the LCM four-part schema."

    phase_drafting:
      primary_tool: "LCM"
      tasks:
        - "Write to the blueprint. Fulfill the functional mandate of each phase."
        - "Focus on achieving the 'Braided Analysis' in the body."
      deliverable: "A complete rough draft."

    phase_revision:
      primary_tool: "HCF"
      tasks:
        - "Line-edit with HCF Principle 2 (High-Fidelity Sentence). Audit each sentence."
        - "Read entire draft to verify HCF Principle 1 (Synthesis) is achieved."
        - "Sharpen conclusion to maximize HCF Principle 3 (Stakes) and Principle 4 (Authorial Presence)."
      deliverable: "A polished final draft ready for submission."

  diagnostic_framework:
    question_for_blocks: "If stuck, ask: 'Am I in an LCM structural phase or an HCF quality phase?'"
    self_check:
      - "Is the structure coherent? -> Consult LCM Blueprint."
      - "Is the prose compelling and the argument significant? -> Apply HCF Principles."

# PART 4: VALIDATION & EXAMPLES (Reference Anchors)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Validation:
  hypothetical_example_using_your_work:
    essay_title: "The Architecture of Belief: Why We Are Losing the Information War"
    lcm_blueprint_applied:
      hook: "Scene in a Balkan 'troll farm'—a specific worker crafting a meme about migrant crime."
      pivot: "This meme is not a 'lie,' but an 'inception seed.' Pivot to analyzing texts: Vosoughi et al. on misinformation spread, Foucault on power/knowledge, a CIA manual on influence ops."
      body: "Braids: The worker's daily targets (narrative) + the psychological theory of 'utility over truth' (theory) + the failure of EU fact-checking regimes (argument)."
      conclusion: "Therefore, democratic societies must shift resources from debunking to building 'epistemic immune systems' via source-hyperaware education. A normative policy call."
    hcf_principles_demonstrated:
      synthesis: "Reconceptualizes 'disinformation' from a truth-telling problem to a cognitive utility engineering problem."
      high_fidelity_sentence: "The meme was not a statement; it was a trapdoor installed in a public conversation." (Advances argument + vivid metaphor)
      so_what: "We are losing a war that threatens the foundational epistemology of liberal democracy. The stakes are civilizational."
      authorial_presence: "Confident deployment of theory and policy analysis to build a novel, commanding thesis.
